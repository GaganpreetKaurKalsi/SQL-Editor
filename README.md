<h1 align="center">SQL Editor - Made in React</h1>

<br>

## üßê Overview
An application created using **ReactJS** and **Sass**.          
You can run SQL queries here.    

The application contains an SQL editor where you can write your query. There are 2 buttons **Clear** and **Run**. You can click on RUN button to run the query. Once RUN is pressed, TableName is searched in the given query and is tallied with the TABLE_NAMES, which is an array of tables names supported by the application. If the table name queried by the user is present in the TABLE_NAMES array, API request is made to fetch data from a URL. Then the data and query is processed with the help of **alasql**. It returns us the data in a JSON format. Then we display the data in form of a table.

The application contains 2 more components - 
- Table Names section which contains the names of the tables supported so user can easily make the queries. SEARCH BAR provided
- History Panel where all the queries RUN are stored with there status. SEARCH BAR provided



_Note : For now only SELECT queries on given tables are supported. Will increase it's application in future._
