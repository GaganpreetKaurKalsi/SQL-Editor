<h1 align="center">SQL Editor - Made with React</h1>

<br>

## üßê Overview
An application created using **ReactJS** and **Sass**.          
**You can run SQL queries here.**    

The application contains an SQL editor where you can write your query. There are 2 buttons **Clear** and **Run**. You can click on RUN button to run the query. Once RUN is pressed, TableName is searched in the given query and is tallied with the TABLE_NAMES, which is an array of tables names supported by the application. If the table name queried by the user is present in the TABLE_NAMES array, API request is made to fetch data from a URL. Then the data and query is processed with the help of **alasql**. It returns us the data in a JSON format. Then we display the data in form of a table.

The application contains 2 more components - 
- **Table Names section** which contains the names of the tables supported so user can easily make the queries. SEARCH BAR provided
- **History Panel** where all the queries RUN are stored with there status. SEARCH BAR provided



_Note : For now only SELECT queries on given tables are supported. Will increase it's application in future._

## üôÑ Page load time
I used Lighthouse Chrome DevTools to check application performace.

**The performance metric varies between 96-98**     
Others remain constant

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps taken to optimize

- Used performace optimization hooks - **memo, useMemo and useCallback** to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of components and increase performance.     
- Used code splitting for the code-editor component. Using code splitting for all components lead to decrease in performance, so applied to only editor.
